This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to run a shoreline change analysis using QSCAT with sample data from Agoo, La Union shorelines. The sample data includes shoreline vectors from 1977, 1988, 2010, and 2022. The process includes generating the baseline vectors, merging the shoreline vectors, and running the shoreline change analysis.

According to the :ref:`plugin_required_inputs` section, the QSCAT requires the two following layers:

   #. Shoreline layer
   #. Baseline layer

Preparing the shoreline vectors
================================

The tracing of shoreline vectors are out of scope in this guide. However, the shoreline vectors are already provided in the sample data. The shoreline vectors are saved as separate shapefile layers for each year. The shoreline vectors are saved as follows:

   #. `Agoo 1977` - shoreline vectors from 1977
   #. `Agoo 1988` - shoreline vectors from 1988
   #. `Agoo 2010` - shoreline vectors from 2010
   #. `Agoo 2022` - shoreline vectors from 2022

You can download the sample data from the following link: <insert link>

Generating the baseline vectors
================================

One of the required inputs for the QSCAT is the baseline vectors. Baseline vectors can be created using the following different strategies:

   #. Creating a buffer of merged shorelines layer.
   #. Creating a buffer of a single shoreline layer.
   #. Manually drawing lines using :guilabel:`Add Line Feature`. 

In this guide, we will choose the first strategy, which is creating a buffer of the merged shorelines layer. Then, we will choose the part of the buffer that best represents the baseline.

.. _others_sample_workflow_mergin_shorelines:

Merging the shoreline vectors
-----------------------------
 
Merging the shoreline step is optional. We only apply this if our digitized shorelines are saved as **separate** shapefile layers. However, in this guide, the Agoo, La Union shorelines are shared as separate shapefile layers. Thus, we will demonstrate here on how to merge these layers. 

However, regardless on what strategy you choose for generating the baseline vectors, the QSCAT requires the shoreline layers to be merged into a single layer. Also, if you choose the first strategy, you should first merge the shoreline layers so that we can create a buffer of all shorelines.

Creating a buffer using QSCAT
-----------------------------

Here, we can start using the QSCAT plugin. The QSCAT plugin has a feature that automates the creation of the :ref:`tab_automator_baseline_buffer`.

#. Open QSCAT if not yet opened. The QSCAT plugin can be open by clicking the |qscat| icon at the top toolbar area near the |python| :guilabel:`Python Console` icon.
  
#. In the QSCAT interface, navigate to :guilabel:`Automator Tab`. Then, in the :guilabel:`Baseline Buffer` section, select the merged shoreline layer from :guilabel:`Input shorelines layer`. Next, enter ``400`` in the :guilabel:`Distance (m)`, click :guilabel:`Buffer`. The buffer will be created and displayed in the map canvas. The buffer will be saved as a temporary layer.

Configuring the shoreline and baseline layer attributes
========================================================

Shorelines
----------

Next, we need to add details of each shoreline such as its date and its uncertainty value of the images. We can use :guilabel:`Shoreline fields automator` to add the required fields for these.

#. Navigate to :guilabel:`Automator Tab`. Then, in the :guilabel:`Shorelines fields`, select the merged shoreline layer from :guilabel:`Shorelines layer`. Make sure |checkbox|:guilabel:`Date field name` and |checkbox| :guilabel:`Uncertainty field name` is both checked. Type the appropriate date field name and uncertainty field name or leave as is. In this example, we choose ``qs_date`` and ``qs_unc`` as the field names. Click :guilabel:`Add Fields`.

      :align: center
      :alt: Automating adding of shoreline fields using Shoreline Fields Automator

      |br|

#. Then, we need to fill in the details of each shoreline. Right click on the merged shoreline layer and select |openTable| :guilabel:`Open Attribute Table`. But first, enable the |toggleEditing| :guilabel:`Toggle Editing` if not yet enabled. In the attribute table, fill in the details of each shoreline such as its date and its uncertainty value. In our sample data, input the following details:

   .. list-table:: Shoreline date and uncertainty of Agoo, La Union shorelines
      :align: center
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 30 20 50

        - 04/2022
        - 15

   According to :ref:`tab_automator_shorelines_fields`, date is in the format of ``MM/YYYY`` and uncertainty is in meters. Also, make sure that details aligns based on the shoreline layer.

Baseline
--------

Baseline also optionally includes fields such as placement, transect length, and orientation. However for this sample data, we will not add any fields because it is only applicable for multi baseline. For more information, refer to :ref:`tab_automator_baseline_fields`.


Configuring the selections of layer and fields
==============================================

#. For shorelines, go to :guilabel:`Shorelines Tab`. 

   In :guilabel:`Layer` section, select the merged shoreline layer as the :guilabel:`Input layer`. Leave :guilabel:`Default data uncertainty` as is; this value is used when no uncertainty value is provided in a shoreline uncertainty field (:ref:`shorelines_parameters`).
   
   In :guilabel:`Fields` section, select the added date (:guilabel:`Year`) and uncertainty (:guilabel:`Uncertainty`) field names, and click :guilabel:`Save`.

   In :guilabel:`Layer` section, select the baseline layer as the :guilabel:`Input layer`.

   In :guilabel:`Placement` section, select |radiobutton| :guilabel:`Sea or offshore` (see :ref:`tab_baseline_placement`).

   In :guilabel:`Orientation` section, select |radiobutton| :guilabel:`Land is to the RIGHT (R)` (see :ref:`tab_baseline_orientation`), and click :guilabel:`Save`.

Casting of transects
====================

We can now start the process of running shoreline change analysis. The first step is to cast transects. The transects are lines that are perpendicular to the baseline. The transects are used to measure the shoreline change statistics.

#. Go to :guilabel:`Transects Tab`.

   In :guilabel:`Layer` section, select a name for the transect layer in :guilabel:`Layer name`. In this example, we leave ``transects`` as is (see :ref:`tab_transects_vector_layer_output_name` how is the output name used).

   In :guilabel:`Count` section, select how would you want the number of transects to be determined. In this example, we choose |radiobutton| :guilabel:`By transect spacing` and leave ``50`` meters as is` (see :ref:`tab_transects_count`).

   In :guilabel:`Parameters` section, leave :guilabel:`Transect length` and :guilabel:`Smoothing distance` as is (see :ref:`tab_transects_parameters`).

   Click :guilabel:`Cast Transect` to start the process of casting transects. The transects will be created and displayed in the map canvas. The transects will be saved as a temporary layer. You can optionally :guilabel:`Save` the selections such that it will be retain when you close QSCAT or QGIS.

Computing the shoreline change
==============================

#. Go to :guilabel:`Shoreline Change Tab`.

   In :guilabel:`General` section, select the created transect layer (note that after every cast the transects layer will be automatically selected here). You can optionally |checkbox| :guilabel:`Clip transects` if you want, this is only for visualization purposes and does not affect statistics. For summary reports location (see :ref:`tab_summary_reports`).

   In :guilabel:`Transect-shoreline intersections`, leave |radiobutton| :guilabel:`Distance` and :guilabel:`Farthest` as is (see :ref:`tab_shoreline_change_tsi`).

   In :guilabel:`Shoreline change statistics`, select statistics you want to calculate, select all via :guilabel:`Select / Deselect All` (see :ref:`tab_shoreline_change_scs`).

   In :guilabel:`NSM and EPR dates`, make sure to select ``04/2022`` in :guilabel:`Newest date` and ``01/1977`` in :guilabel:`Oldest date` (see :ref:`tab_shoreline_change_pcs`).

   In :guilabel:`Additional parameters`, leave :guilabel:`Confidence interval (%)` as is (see :ref:`tab_shoreline_change_additional_parameters`).

   Click :guilabel:`Compute Shoreline Change` to start the process of computing shoreline change. The shoreline change statistics will be calculated and the transects will be displayed in the map canvas. The statistics will be saved as a temporary layer. You can optionally :guilabel:`Save` the selections such that it will be retain when you close QSCAT or QGIS (see :ref:`tab_shoreline_change_vector_layer_output_name`) for layer outputs.

Running optional features
=========================

Computing the area change
-------------------------

This feature requires a polygon area to encompass which would you like to get the area change. Usually, we designed this for a specific area of interest like municipality or barangay boundaries. If you want to get the area change on whole area at once then you can draw a polygon that encompasses the whole area. For this sample data, we will get the area change on the whole area.

------------------------------------

#. Go to :guilabel:`Visualization Tab`

   In :guilabel:`Layer`, select a statistic layer to apply visualization in :guilabel:`Shoreline change statistic layer`. In this example, we choose the NSM statistic layer. Select the field of NSM layer with the statistic value in :guilabel:`Statistic value field`, and manually input the value of the uncertainty in :guilabel:`Uncertainty value (SCE, NSM, EPR)`.

   In :guilabel:`Color ramp`, select ``Equal Interval`` as the :guilabel:`Mode`.Leave the number of :guilabel:`Negative classes` and :guilabel:`Positive classes` as is, and click :guilabel:`Visualize`.
