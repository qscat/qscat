- **Shoreline change:** computes shoreline change statistics: shoreline change envelope (SCE), net shoreline movement (NSM), end-point rate (EPR), linear regression rate (LRR), and weighted linear regression rate (WLR).
  
- **Area change:** calculates length and area of accreting, stable, and eroding coastal segments.

- **Forecasting:** predict future shoreline positions including uncertainty areas.

- **Automator:** plugin offer tools that automate manual repetitive tasks.
  
- **Data visualization:** shoreline and area change, forecasting results are visualized in the map for easy interpretation.

- **Summary report:** generates a comprehensive summary reports of the analysis results.


Shoreline Change
----------------

Computes shoreline change statistics distance measurements, rate of change, and supplemental statistics.

Distance measurements
.....................

- Shoreline Change Envelope (SCE)
- Net Shoreline Movement (NSM)

Rate-of-change statistics

- Weighted Linear Regression Rate (WLR)

Supplemental statistics
.......................

- Uncertainty of End-Point Rate (EPR_unc)
- R-Squared of Linear Regression Rate (LRR and WLR)
- Standard Error of Linear Regression (LSE and WSE)
- Confidence Interval of Linear Regression (LCI and WCI)
