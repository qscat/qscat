Tab: Shoreline Change
*********************

After casting the transects, QSCAT is now ready to calculate the following shoreline change statistics: (a) shoreline change envelope (SCE), (b) net shoreline movement (NSM), (c) end point rate (EPR), and (d) linear regression rate (LRR). The first three statistics (SCE, NSM and EPR) require only two shoreline vectors while LRR requires at least three (3) shoreline vectors to compute the rate of change. Note that both SCE and NSM refer to magnitude or distance in meters (m) while EPR and LRR are rate-of-change statistics, in meters/year (m/y).
